# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automated deployment of the PNR Tracker web application to Netlify through GitHub integration. The system will automatically deploy the application when changes are pushed to the main branch, providing continuous deployment capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Netlify_System**: The Netlify hosting platform that provides continuous deployment services
- **GitHub_Repository**: The Git repository hosted on GitHub containing the application source code
- **Deployment_Pipeline**: The automated process that builds and deploys the application
- **Build_Process**: The compilation and optimization steps required to prepare the application for production
- **Environment_Variables**: Configuration values required for the application to run in production

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically deploy my application to Netlify when I push code to GitHub, so that I can have continuous deployment without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch, THE Netlify_System SHALL automatically trigger a new deployment
2. THE Netlify_System SHALL successfully build the application using the configured Build_Process
3. IF the build fails, THEN THE Netlify_System SHALL provide detailed error logs and notifications
4. THE Netlify_System SHALL make the deployed application accessible via a public URL
5. THE Netlify_System SHALL maintain deployment history and allow rollbacks to previous versions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure build settings and environment variables for Netlify deployment, so that my application runs correctly in the production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Netlify_System SHALL use the specified build command to compile the application
2. THE Netlify_System SHALL publish files from the designated output directory
3. THE Netlify_System SHALL apply configured Environment_Variables during the build and runtime
4. THE Netlify_System SHALL support custom redirect rules and headers configuration
5. WHERE custom domain is configured, THE Netlify_System SHALL serve the application from that domain

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up GitHub integration with Netlify, so that deployments are triggered automatically from my repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL be connected to the Netlify_System with appropriate permissions
2. THE Netlify_System SHALL have read access to the GitHub_Repository source code
3. THE Netlify_System SHALL monitor the main branch for new commits
4. WHEN a pull request is created, THE Netlify_System SHALL generate deploy previews
5. THE Netlify_System SHALL update deployment status in GitHub commit checks
### 
Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure deployment notifications and monitoring, so that I'm informed about deployment status and can quickly respond to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment succeeds, THE Netlify_System SHALL send success notifications
2. IF a deployment fails, THEN THE Netlify_System SHALL send failure notifications with error details
3. THE Netlify_System SHALL provide deployment logs accessible through the dashboard
4. THE Netlify_System SHALL monitor application uptime and performance metrics
5. WHERE webhook notifications are configured, THE Netlify_System SHALL send deployment events to specified endpoints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure secure deployment practices, so that my application and deployment process are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Netlify_System SHALL use secure HTTPS connections for all deployed applications
2. THE Netlify_System SHALL validate GitHub webhook signatures to ensure authentic requests
3. THE Netlify_System SHALL protect Environment_Variables from unauthorized access
4. THE Netlify_System SHALL implement proper access controls for deployment settings
5. WHERE custom headers are configured, THE Netlify_System SHALL apply security headers to protect against common vulnerabilities
