## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
cd modern-pnr-frontend
npm install
npx playwright install
```

### Run All E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Core functionality only
npx playwright test e2e/01-core-functionality.spec.ts

# Performance tests only
npx playwright test e2e/05-performance-benchmarks.spec.ts

# Accessibility tests only
npx playwright test e2e/04-accessibility-compliance.spec.ts
```

### Run Tests with UI
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Run Tests in Headed Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Debug Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Run Tests on Specific Browsers
```bash
# Chrome only
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Firefox only
npx playwright test --project=firefox

# Safari only
npx playwright test --project=webkit

# Mobile Chrome
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Chrome"
```

## Test Configuration

The tests are configured in `playwright.config.ts` with:
- Multiple browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile device testing (Pixel 5, iPhone 12)
- Automatic retry on failure
- Screenshot and video capture on failure
- HTML, JSON, and JUnit reporting

## Test Data and Fixtures

Test data is centralized in `fixtures/test-data.ts`:
- Sample PNR data for testing
- Performance thresholds
- Mock user data

## Utilities and Helpers

### Accessibility Helper (`utils/accessibility-helpers.ts`)
- Axe-core integration for automated accessibility testing
- Keyboard navigation testing utilities
- ARIA validation helpers
- Screen reader compatibility checks

### Performance Helper (`utils/performance-helpers.ts`)
- Web Vitals measurement utilities
- Bundle size analysis
- Memory usage monitoring
- Performance threshold validation

### PWA Helper (`utils/pwa-helpers.ts`)
- Service worker testing utilities
- Manifest validation
- Offline capability testing
- Cache strategy verification

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are integrated into GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`):
- Runs on all browsers for every PR
- Separate accessibility audit job
- Performance monitoring job
- Artifact upload for test results and videos

## Performance Thresholds

The tests enforce the following performance thresholds:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
- Time to First Byte (TTFB): < 800ms

## Accessibility Standards

Tests ensure compliance with:
- WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Keyboard navigation requirements
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Touch target sizes (44px minimum)

## Mobile Testing

Mobile tests cover:
- Touch gestures and interactions
- Responsive design validation
- Mobile-specific features
- Performance on mobile devices
- Offline functionality on mobile

## Voice Interface Testing

Voice tests validate:
- Web Speech API integration
- Voice command recognition
- Text-to-speech functionality
- Multi-language support
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Reporting

Test results are available in multiple formats:
- HTML report with screenshots and videos
- JSON report for programmatic analysis
- JUnit XML for CI/CD integration
- Performance metrics in JSON format

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests failing due to timing**: Increase timeouts in playwright.config.ts
2. **Accessibility violations**: Check console output for specific axe-core violations
3. **Performance threshold failures**: Review Web Vitals measurements in test output
4. **Mobile gesture tests failing**: Ensure proper viewport size and touch simulation

### Debug Mode

Use debug mode to step through tests:
```bash
npx playwright test --debug e2e/01-core-functionality.spec.ts
```

### Headed Mode

Run tests with visible browser:
```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Add appropriate test data to fixtures
3. Update this README with new test coverage
4. Ensure tests are mapped to specific requirements
5. Add proper error handling and cleanup

## Test Maintenance

- Review and update test data regularly
- Monitor performance thresholds and adjust as needed
- Update accessibility standards as WCAG evolves
- Keep browser versions updated in CI/CD
- Review and optimize test execution time
