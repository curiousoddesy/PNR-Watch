- [ ] Backup procedures configured

## ðŸ§ª Testing Verification

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Individual test suites
npm run test                    # Unit tests
npm run test:integration       # E2E integration tests
npm run test:performance       # Performance tests
```

### Manual Verification
- [ ] User registration and login working
- [ ] PNR addition and management functional
- [ ] Status checking operational (with valid PNRs)
- [ ] Email notifications sending
- [ ] Push notifications working
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Error handling graceful

## ðŸ“Š Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: < 1000ms average
- **95th Percentile**: < 2000ms
- **Error Rate**: < 5%
- **Throughput**: > 1 request/second
- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB per service

### Load Testing Results
Run `npm run test:performance` to verify:
- Concurrent user handling
- Database performance under load
- API endpoint response times
- Memory usage patterns
- Error handling under stress

## ðŸ”§ Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
- **Application Health**: `/health` endpoint
- **Detailed Monitoring**: `/api/monitoring/health`
- **System Metrics**: `/api/monitoring/metrics`
- **Database Health**: Connection and query performance

### Log Management
- **Application Logs**: `backend/logs/`
- **Access Logs**: Nginx access logs
- **Error Logs**: Application and system error logs
- **Security Logs**: Authentication and security events

### Backup Strategy
- **Database Backups**: Daily automated backups
- **Application Backups**: Code and configuration
- **Log Retention**: 30-day log retention policy
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular backup restoration tests

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Check `DATABASE_URL` in backend/.env
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check firewall settings for port 5432

2. **JWT Token Errors**
   - Verify `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` are set
   - Check token expiration settings
   - Ensure secrets are consistent across restarts

3. **Email Notifications Not Working**
   - Verify SMTP configuration in backend/.env
   - Check email provider settings (Gmail app passwords)
   - Test with simple email client

4. **High Memory Usage**
   - Monitor with `docker stats` or `htop`
   - Check for memory leaks in application logs
   - Consider horizontal scaling

5. **IRCTC Scraping Issues**
   - IRCTC website changes may break scraping
   - Check CSS selectors in `config/selectors.ts`
   - Implement fallback mechanisms

### Performance Issues
- **Slow Database Queries**: Check indexes and query optimization
- **High CPU Usage**: Profile application and optimize bottlenecks
- **Network Latency**: Use CDN for static assets
- **Memory Leaks**: Monitor heap usage and garbage collection

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Load balancer configuration (nginx, HAProxy)
- Multiple backend instances
- Shared Redis and PostgreSQL instances
- Session store externalization

### Database Scaling
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Database partitioning for large datasets
- Query optimization and indexing

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for session and application caching
- Browser caching headers
- CDN for static assets
- API response caching

## ðŸ”’ Security Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
- [ ] Monthly dependency updates
- [ ] Quarterly security assessments
- [ ] Annual penetration testing
- [ ] Continuous vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Regular backup testing
- [ ] Security log review

### Incident Response

- [ ] Emergency contact procedures
- [ ] Backup restoration procedures
- [ ] Communication protocols
- [ ] Post-incident review process
